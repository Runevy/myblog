# My Reading Journey Begins at 22

I'm just a mere human in a stranded internet land that want to share something personal today. For 22 years of my life, I've never actually finished reading a book. Not a single one. It sounds strange maybe, but that's my truth.

Growing up, I always found excuses. Too busy, too distracted, or just not interested enough. The internet was always there with quick answers and entertainment. Why spend weeks on a book when YouTube can explain it in 10 minutes?

But something changed in me recently. Looking at Indonesia's political landscape in 2025, with the new regulations limiting online speech and the Virtual Police unit monitoring social media for "radical" comments, I felt a chill down my spine. When I heard about people being investigated under the UU ITE law just for their social media posts and the government's increasing control over digital platforms, I couldn't help but think of a book everyone kept referencing - "1984" by George Orwell.

## Why 1984?

I chose "1984" because it seems eerily relevant to what's happening right now in Indonesia. The recently passed RUU TNI law in March 2025 has expanded the military's role in civilian affairs, allowing them to take positions in government without resigning from service. What's most concerning is how this law gives the military authority over "cyber defense" operations.

The Ministry of Defense claims these cyber operations are only meant to counter "threats to national sovereignty" and not to spy on civilians. But when they talk about targeting "information and disinformation operations," it's hard not to wonder who decides what counts as "disinformation." Will criticism of the government suddenly become a "threat to national sovereignty"?

Add to this the government's use of "buzzers" - paid commentators who manipulate public opinion on social media. These buzzers work to shape narratives favorable to those in power, attacking opposition voices and creating an atmosphere where people think twice before expressing their honest thoughts online. It's like a digital version of the "thought police" that Orwell wrote about.

With our government implementing new surveillance systems and the Ministry of Communication's Regulation 5 requiring all digital services to register or risk being blocked, the parallels to Orwell's dystopia were too strong to ignore. I wanted to understand firsthand what Orwell was warning us about decades ago.

The idea that civil servants can't criticize the government online and that people are being detained for discussing certain political topics made me wonder how close we're getting to the world Orwell imagined. It felt like the right time to finally pick up a book and see what all the warnings were about.

## My Experience So Far (Chapters 1-3)

The beginning was hard. I'm not used to focusing on pages of text for long periods. My mind wanted to wander, check my phone, or do literally anything else. But I pushed through, and something interesting happened.

Winston Smith's world started to feel real to me. The grim apartment buildings, the telescreens watching everything, the constant propaganda - it all creates this suffocating atmosphere that I could actually feel while reading. Sometimes, when I read about the telescreens monitoring Winston's every move, I glance at my own phone and wonder how different it really is.

I was surprised by how much I connected with Winston. He's this ordinary guy trapped in an extraordinary nightmare, just trying to hold onto his humanity. When he started writing in his diary, that small act of rebellion felt huge. It's like watching someone light a match in complete darkness.

By Chapter 3, I'm already seeing disturbing similarities between the book and our reality. The way information is controlled, how history is rewritten, and the constant surveillance - it's all there in our world, just in different forms. When Winston thinks about thoughtcrime, I think about how careful people in Indonesia have become about what they post online.

## What I'm Learning About Reading

Reading is different from consuming other media. It's slower, more intimate. The story builds in your mind rather than being shown to you. I'm finding that I remember more details and think more deeply about what I'm reading compared to when I watch something.

I'm also learning that reading takes practice. Each chapter gets a little easier as my brain adjusts to this different way of processing information. It's like exercising a muscle I never knew I had.

## Going Forward

I'm committed to finishing "1984" - my first complete book at age 22. It feels like I've been missing out on something important all these years, and I'm excited to discover more books after this one.

If you're like me and have avoided reading books, maybe give it a try. Start with something that genuinely interests you or feels relevant to your life. It might be difficult at first, but push through. The world inside books is different from the one in movies or social media - it's more personal somehow.

I'll update you all when I finish the book and share my final thoughts. For now, I'm off to continue Winston's journey through the world of Big Brother and see where it leads.

Has anyone else read "1984"? What did you think? Or are there other books you'd recommend for a reading newbie like me?
