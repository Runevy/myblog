# **Orb: On the Movements of the Earth** - _A Masterpiece of Philosophy and Hope_

## Introduction

"_Orb: On the Movements of the Earth_" is a **profound anime** produced by Madhouse that transcends the typical anime narrative. Set in 15th century Poland, the story revolves around the **heliocentric theory** - the idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun - during a time when such beliefs were considered heretical by the Church.

But as I discovered while watching this masterpiece, the anime isn't merely about astronomical theories; it's a deep philosophical exploration of **_human nature, belief, hope, and our responsibility to future generations_**.

## Plot Overview

The anime begins with twelve-year-old prodigy **Rafal**, who initially believes in living rationally to earn society's praise. His life changes dramatically when he encounters a mysterious man who sparks his passion for astronomy. Rafal becomes **determined to prove heliocentrism**, despite the Church's promotion of geocentrism as the sole truth of the universe.

What makes "_Orb_" unique is its lack of a traditional protagonist. Instead of following one character throughout, the story presents a **revolving door of characters** who each contribute to advancing knowledge about heliocentrism before passing the torch to the next person. This narrative choice brilliantly illustrates how progress often spans generations, with each person adding their small contribution to a larger truth.

## The Attachment of Human to Belief

A fascinating psychological aspect explored in "_Orb_" is how humans develop **deep attachments to theories** they've invested their lives in. Count Piast and the former Bishop exemplify this phenomenon - having dedicated decades to geocentric models, they resist heliocentrism not merely due to religious doctrine, but because accepting it would _invalidate their life's work_.

The anime subtly portrays how these characters unconsciously **eliminate evidence contradicting their established beliefs**. This cognitive bias isn't portrayed as villainous but as _deeply human_ - we all tend to protect our intellectual investments. When faced with anomalies in their geocentric calculations, they create increasingly complex mathematical adjustments rather than questioning the fundamental premise.

This is precisely why **Oczy** emphasizes the _vital importance of debate and questioning_ to Badeni. He suggests that truth emerges not from isolated conviction but from the crucible of challenge and discourse. The anime thus presents scientific progress as inherently social, requiring both **passionate advocates** and **thoughtful skeptics** to advance toward truth.

## The Philosophy of Future Impact

One of the most powerful themes in "_Orb_" is how our present actions may not immediately affect us or the world around us but can **profoundly impact future generations**. This philosophical stance encourages viewers (read: me) to appreciate and make more effort to live meaningfully in the present, guided by both our beliefs and our questions.

The anime also beautifully portrays how humans can simultaneously hold **contradicting beliefs** (like _doublethink_ in [1984]({{<relref "posts/1984.md">}}))- a complexity of human cognition that allows us to explore new ideas even when they challenge established truths. This cognitive dissonance becomes a _catalyst for progress_ rather than an obstacle.

## The Trust in Passing Down Our Legacy

Another compelling aspect of "_Orb_" is its exploration of how we pass our beliefs, inspirations, and motivations to our descendants. The anime acknowledges that this transmission can fail, yet emphasizes the **importance of maintaining hope**. The characters in the story may never see the "sunrise" they're working toward, yet they continue their pursuit of truth for future generations.

This theme resonates deeply because it reminds us that **progress often requires sacrifice** without the guarantee of witnessing the fruits of our labor. Yet, the hope that someone in the future will build upon our work gives _meaning to our present struggles_.

## The Alternate Universe Theory

The final part of the anime presents an intriguing twist when **Rafal suddenly reappears** as Albert Brudzewski's teacher. This can be interpreted as an _alternate universe_ where Rafal chose to lie in court to receive a recommendation to university, allowing his research about heliocentrism to be burned (or perhaps not).

This interpretation suggests that Rafal's earlier decision to poison himself was a choice to **maintain his integrity** rather than compromise his beliefs. In this alternate timeline, if the stone chest with a letter giving Potocki 10% was preserved, it might have been discovered and delivered to Potocki's house after Albert reached adulthood.

The ending timeline is like this:

- Rafal lies in court and attends university to study theology.
- The stone chest might not have been burned (he only burned others material), and the letter he wrote remains inside.
- Someone discovers the chest and conducts research on heliocentrism.
- After completing his studies, Rafal returns to his village and becomes a teacher.
- With a theology degree, he earns respect and a prominent position in the village.
- Rafal becomes Albert's teacher.
- Albert's father is one of the heliocentric researchers.
- Albert's father possibly passes down a knowledge on heliocentrism.
- Rafal kills Albert's father and gets arrested.
- Albert grows up and works in a bakery.
- The heliocentric theory is solved and disseminated through a book titled "On the Movement of the Earth."
- The message is sent to the Potocki home.
- Albert heard the title of the book and questioning about geocentric theory.
- The book "On the Movement of the Earth" is never released like in the original universe, or it could be discovered elsewhere but not widely distributed.
- Albert become Copernicus Teacher
- And the rest is history

The parallel characters between timelines are fascinating:

- **Albert** as an alternate universe version of _Oczy_
- **Albert's father** as an alternate universe of _Oczy's mentor_
- **The Church Pastor** as _Badeni's_ alternate universe counterpart
- Of course _Rafal_ as _Rafal_

This complex narrative structure invites viewers to contemplate how **different choices lead to different futures**, and how truth can persist through various timelines and vessels.

## Conclusion

"_Orb: On the Movements of the Earth_" isn't simply about teaching viewers the heliocentric theory or promoting one belief system. Instead, it's a **profound meditation on hope, the philosophy of life, and human nature**. The anime reminds us that progress is often incremental, spanning generations, and that our contributions, however small, matter to the grand tapestry of human knowledge.

For its philosophical depth, historical context, beautiful animation, and thought-provoking narrative, "_Orb: On the Movements of the Earth_" deserves a **perfect 10/10 score**. It's a reminder that anime can be a powerful medium for exploring complex ideas about human existence and our place in the universe.
