# The Last Supper (2025) by Mauro Borrelli

In anticipation of Passover, I decided to watch "The Last Supper," a 2025 film directed by Mauro Borrelli. I attended a morning service at my local church before heading to the theater with my sisters and grandmother. While the film is not biblically accurate, it offers an intriguing perspective on the Last Supper through the eyes of Judas and Peter.

The portrayal of Peter was commendable, capturing the emotional turmoil and inner conflict, especially during the scenes where Peter denies Jesus three times and their reunion on the beach after a night of unsuccessful fishing. However, Jamie Ward's portrayal of Jesus felt lacking in the depth and love that one might expect from such a man called Christ.

The film, while entertaining, takes creative liberties with the biblical narrative, which is common in many Bible-inspired films. It's important to view it as a form of entertainment rather than a factual retelling of the scriptures. Despite its shortcomings, the movie serves as a reminder of the Passover events, emphasizing not only Jesus' death and resurrection but also his teachings about the bread and wine as symbols of his body and blood.

Overall, "The Last Supper" is a visually striking film with moments of emotional depth, particularly in its depiction of Judas' spiritual struggle. While it may not meet the expectations of those seeking a dynamic narrative, it offers a reflective viewing experience for those interested in faith-based cinema.

For the score I give it a 6/10.
